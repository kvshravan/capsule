# Capsule ( Draft Idea )
1. Assign a color to capsule. One of RGB (256*256*256) possible capsules. 16.7M capsules possible
2. Capsule expiry = X days? Color back to available after expiry
3. Merge two capsules. Color becomes part of bigger capsule
4. Global search across capsules
Trust and Opinion matters.
